### **Over 90% of people admit to procrastination having a significant impact on their life.**

When you are regularly putting off tasks you know you should be getting on with, you cause yourself extra stress and anxiety, and may never complete the task as well as you could have done if you didn’t procrastinate.

Procrastination happens for several reasons, including a lack of motivation, sense of purpose, and confidence that you will be able to complete the task successfully. The good news is that all the reasons for procrastination can be treated with self-hypnosis and creating powerful new pathways in your subconscious mind to put a stop to procrastination, forever.

**Marisa Peer’s ‘Stop Procrastinating’ self-hypnosis audio will help you put an end to procrastination** by actively engaging your subconscious mind, giving you the motivation and drive to get tasks done. Motivation comes from deep within your mind, and if you want to experience a significant change in your life, hypnosis can rewire your mind to get there.

As you complete the hypnosis audio you will stop sabotaging yourself by procrastination. You’ll no longer feel guilty when you are procrastinating or stressed as you rush to complete tasks because procrastination will be a thing of the past in your life. You will feel like you can take on any task and be confident you can complete it successfully without the fear of failure.
