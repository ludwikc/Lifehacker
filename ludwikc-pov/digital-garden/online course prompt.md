here's the plan of my online course about resilience. the course will be called "strong head".  read it all, and then draft the contents of the first module.  module should consist of 5 to 6 lessons. considering this will be an online course, each module should be no more than 1 hour (spoken at typical pace) and each lesson should be around 10 mins. adjust the contents accordingly. remember that the course consists of 8 modules, so make sure none of the lessons could be perceived as duplicates among the modules. each lesson should cover no more than one crucial topic for the subject matter. at the end suggest a "challenge" that the student should do and share the results on our Discord. the challenge should include some form of social interaction.
