## 💁‍♂️ Background

I have worked in many different positions and teams for the past 6 years. At the beginning of my career, I started as a print graphic designer and then moved in to digital and product design. For the past few years, I’ve been developing B2B apps, I’ve worked with Company 1, Company 2, and now I have been focusing on User Research and Design Systems development for a while.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why I joined Example Company

To be honest, I wasn't actively looking for a new job, and I didn’t know XX before, but when I just found the job post on my LinkedIn feed and check what this company is about, it was instant love. ❤️

I love great UI and UX. Which is also a key factor for XX. And then, of course, it turned out that it is also a local company, and this was the cherry on the top 🍒.

From the very beginning I loved all interactions with XX: I really enjoyed the interview process, I love that my offer letter was full of emojis 🥳 😄 ✅ and was indeed helpful, and I really like the way everyone treats each other. All of this just confirmed in me, that I am now joining a place where people are very much like me. 😊

## 🙋‍♂️ What should the team know about me?

I think that having colleagues who are helpful and who are just as motivated as me is a key point. So I try to be that kind of team player: I’m optimistic, I almost all the time have the “can do” attitude and I always try to help resolve problems. 💪

### Personal

- 📚️ 🎥 I love to read (especially sci-fi) and love good movies as well.
- 🤔 💡 I try to be productive in my spare time as well, I’m always working on an idea.
- 🧑‍🍳 I love to cook, and I love Italian food 🇮🇹, especially arrabbiata 🍝 🌶️
