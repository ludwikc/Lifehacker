Hi there, 

A good chunk of our my 1,400 lifehackers are already raving about [App Name] in 2 communities I run. 

It's clear they value what you offer. 

Building on this momentum, I was thinking we could collaborate. 

Offering them a special discount might just be the nudge for more of our members to jump on board with [App Name]. 

What do you think?

Best,
Ludwik
