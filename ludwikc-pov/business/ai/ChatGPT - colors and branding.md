Thank you for providing the details about your personal brand. As a branding expert, I'll suggest a color palette and a set of fonts that will help you convey the luxury and modernity you're aiming for. Based on your preferences, here's what I recommend:

Color Palette:

1.  Midnight Blue (#191970): This color is a deep and rich blue that symbolizes luxury while still being modern. It will work well with the pitch-black background in your videos.
2.  Electric Purple (#9C27B0): This vibrant purple will add a touch of modernity and will help you stand out from the typical cyberpunk color schemes.
3.  Platinum (#E5E4E2): This light, metallic shade will provide contrast and sophistication, reinforcing the luxurious aspect of your brand.
4.  Neon Green (#39FF14): To add a bold and modern touch, use this color sparingly in your designs, such as in icons or as an accent color.

Fonts: Emblem: Since you've been using Trajan Pro, I suggest you try 'Cinzel' as an alternative. It's a similar serif font with a touch of luxury and elegance, perfect for emblems or logos.

For your website:

1.  Headings: 'Montserrat' is a clean, modern sans-serif font that will complement your luxury-modern theme.
2.  Leads: 'Roboto Slab' provides a nice balance between modernity and readability, making it ideal for leads and subheadings.
3.  Content: 'Lato' is a versatile sans-serif font that is easy to read and will pair well with the other fonts on your website.

These colors and fonts should work together to create a bold, modern, and luxurious feel for your personal brand. Remember to use the colors and fonts consistently across all communication platforms to reinforce your brand identity.
