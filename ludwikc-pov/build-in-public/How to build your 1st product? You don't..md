Yes, you scale upward. But you build downward.

You can't build a product without **knowing** it will sell. 

You can't sell a product to 10s, 100s or 1000s of people if you can't sell it to 1 person. 

If you can't get 1 person to listen to you for 90 minutes, how can you expect 1000 people to sit through your 90 minutes webinar?
