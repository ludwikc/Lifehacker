Hi Ludwik

Welcome and thanks for signing up!

I built Akiflow because, as a manager and entrepreneur, I needed a tool to help me manage my tasks and plan in a faster way so that I could be **more consistent in keeping myself well organized.**

  
I believe that to be productive, you need to

-   Keep a universal inbox
-   Be able to prioritize, plan (and re-plan!) fast
-   Maintain a clear and unified view of your schedule

So I build a software that makes it 10x faster to do all the above.

**  
Why do we care?**  
  
Being productive boosts your mood, makes you accomplished and gives you back time for yourself.  
  
Unfortunately, there's no one-fits-all solution to productivity.  
We are all different and we keep changing.  
Our focus, energy level, consistency and activities change on a daily basis.  
  
That's why we built a software that can adjust to your methodology and makes it **much faster** to perform the basic actions so that you can be consistent in keeping yourself organized and productive.

Productivity is happiness, and we love the mission.  

**Welcome!**

We are glad to have you onboard and would love to hear your feedback and ideas on our [Idea Portal](https://akiflow.intercom-clicks.com/via/e?ob=RtfGqC00yTYmUrH27HYJYjfqN5p8HgnNA1MUQWBxXVkIA%2FAFYZ6hmbg7IrV1fdESU8wM50K6tek4x2D%2B4YKLGw%3D%3D&h=d6d4f94c0ce81ad9e9c60ff5688a35d6b0f5816b-hqlby49q_160174300418291&l=6d9e546ed55c56663ae744592fd1cef4b8e94306-7957539).
